It's a simple HTML and CSS project designed to teach accessibility concepts through hands-on exercises.

## Getting Started

Since this is a pure HTML and CSS project, you just need a basic HTTP server to run it. Here are a couple of options:

### Using Node.js

If you have Node.js installed:

```bash
# Install the http-server package globally
npm install -g http-server

# Run the server (from the project directory)
http-server

# The site will be available at http://localhost:8080
```

### Using Python

If you have Python installed:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# The site will be available at http://localhost:8000
```
